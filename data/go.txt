Go, also known as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.
There are two major implementations:
    Google's self-hosting compiler toolchain targeting multiple operating systems, mobile devices, and WebAssembly.
    gccgo, a GCC frontend.
A third party transpiler, GopherJS, compiles Go to JavaScript for front-end web development.
